# Botnet-Detection-Unsupervised-ML

Hello World, this repo is an implementation of the **[N-BaIoT: Network-based Detection of IoT Botnet Attacks Using Deep Autoencoders]** 
paper written by Yair Meidan, Michael Bohadana, Yael Mathov, Yisroel Mirsky, Dominik Breitenbacher, Asaf Shabtai, and Yuval Elovici.

In this project, I provide a Jupyter Notebook to take you step-by-step through the implementation process according to the paper. I also provide a scripted version of the notebook to run the analysis and reproduce the results. Happy learning!
